You are reviewing and improving the backend of my AI-powered book generation SaaS platform called Prompt2Book.
It manages user accounts, AI-generated books, file storage, and payment subscriptions through Stripe.

Please carefully:

üîç 1Ô∏è‚É£ Debug the Current Backend Code
Check for API endpoint errors, typos, bad requests, missing error handling, or unhandled promise rejections.

Confirm that book generation, image generation, book preview, edit, download, and delete endpoints are cleanly built and functioning.

Review and debug all database calls: check table/collection names, field references, insert/update/query logic, and ensure proper error handling is in place.

Validate JWT or session-based auth ‚Äî confirm tokens are securely verified and user sessions are properly gated.

Ensure file uploads and downloads are secure, with private storage, expiring download links, and correct MIME type handling for PDFs and images.

Inspect for console errors, CORS issues, and ensure all environment variables are properly scoped and not exposed to the client.

Suggest performance improvements: API rate limiting, AI prompt input debouncing, lazy loading of images and books in the dashboard, caching AI-generated images if possible.

üí≥ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate and Test Stripe Billing
Add Stripe Checkout integration with 2 plans:

Creator ‚Äî $9.99/month

Pro ‚Äî $19.98/month

Set up API endpoints for creating Stripe checkout sessions.

On successful payment:

Update the users table/collection with: active plan name, price, Stripe customer ID, subscription start/renewal dates.

Ensure subscription details are reflected in the dashboard view.

Implement and test Stripe webhook handlers for:

checkout.session.completed

customer.subscription.updated

customer.subscription.deleted

Return checkout session URLs to the frontend for redirect.

Include proper error handling for failed payment intents or cancelled sessions.

Test all payment and webhook flows in Stripe Test Mode.

Suggest fallback logic if a payment webhook is delayed (to avoid locking users out).

üìë 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize Backend Structure and Logic
Review route organization:
Should be cleanly structured (e.g. /api/create-book, /api/download, /api/edit-book, /api/create-image, /api/payment/create-session, /api/payment/webhook).

Ensure storage/file client is properly initialized and managed in all routes.

Confirm environment variables and API keys are safely handled in .env files and not exposed to the frontend.

Suggest improvements if the code can be better modularized (e.g. utility functions for PDF generation, image creation, database interactions).

Check for duplicate code blocks and refactor where needed.

üìä 4Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Storage and Data Structure
Review existing database tables/collections:

users

books

images

subscriptions (if applicable)

Confirm primary keys, foreign keys (if relational), and data types make sense.

Suggest improvements like adding created_at, updated_at, status, plan fields where useful.

Review storage structure:

Confirm organized folders for books, images, cover images, and user-specific storage paths (e.g. books/user-id/book-id.pdf).

Ensure file permissions and URL expiration settings are correctly applied.

üìå 5Ô∏è‚É£ My Suggestions / Improvements Beyond What‚Äôs Asked:
Add a retry mechanism for failed AI prompt generations or file uploads.

Include a manual regenerate images button per book in the dashboard.

Enable PDF viewer with in-page text editing and per-page AI rewriting using prompts (if not already implemented).

Add option to select page ranges when generating a book.

Integrate a grace period buffer before revoking access after a payment failure.

Optimize AI image generation by batching prompts where possible.

Future-proof by adding plan upgrade/downgrade support via Stripe‚Äôs Customer Portal.

Suggest adding request logs or lightweight error monitoring with a tool like LogSnag, LogRocket, or Sentry.

Implement CORS protection ‚Äî allow requests only from approved frontend domains.

also add animations and improve ui.
